We are excited about your interest to integrate Weemo Cloud video functionality into your web-based application. Third parties can get more information on how to create a proof-of-concept integration by visiting the wiki and downloading the necessary code.

Optionally, third parties can submit their proof of concept integrations directly on github.


# Introduction

The wiki presents a basic and functional methodology for integrating the Weemo video driver and cloud technologies in a web application as a proof-of-concept.

The use cases have been minimized in order to reduce the integration effort while creating a functional model for the POC that covers most of the use cases for audio/video and screen sharing during 1:1 calls and multi-party calls. 

> Proof-of-concept projects do not require the integration between the Weemo cloud and the web application backend to handle account provisioning and authentication. Using a special authentication key, provided by Weemo, POC implementation can perform auto account provisioning.

# About Weemo

The Weemo Video Cloud is a solution specifically targeted at application software vendors providing real-time video communications embedded within any web or mobile application.  The solution is particularly well suited for social software applications such as Enterprise Social Networks, Social CRM, HCM, Customer Service, Education and E-learning, as well as for Contact Management and Collaboration. 

Weemo relies on open-standard protocols such as SIP, XMPP and HTTPS. The solution provides constant interoperability with existing or future communication-oriented devices and infrastructures.

Weemo provides both the client technology and integration means and a worldwide cloud infrastructure. These building blocks are designed to work together as one easy-to-use solution. The application vendor, provider of the web application to be integrated with Weemo, will implement JavaScript commands in order to control local clients and, as needed, will have access to REST APIs to perform management tasks including provisioning named users.
